## My process

I used Figma as a reference for style values, converted px to rem and stylized html accordingly. Then I figured out how to make the layout responsive.

### Built with

- Flexbox
- Figma
- Chrome device toolbar

### What I learned

I learned to use font-face in my project, improved my flexbox knowledge and, most importantly, learned how to make the layout responsive with @media and max width calculation using calc().

### Continued development

I would like to enhance my knowledge of responsive design and make the code look cleaner, as my CSS file looks like a mess.
